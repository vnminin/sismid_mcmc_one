# This function draws numerical samples from the joint posterior 
# predictive distribution of frequencies n1, n11, n111 and n12.
# Each individual sample is based on one realisation (sample) from the posterior
# distribution of the escape probability q and a subsequent draw from the 
# corresponding multinomial distribution. In this model, the escape probability 
# is the same across all 334 households.
#
# The function outputs the mean of the predictive distribution, based on the 
# sample. In addition, the joint predictive distribution of 
# frequencies n1 and n11 is plotted.
